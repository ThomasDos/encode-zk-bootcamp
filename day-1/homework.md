## Homework 1

### Maths Introduction

##### Some modular arithmetic

1. Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} // Modulus 7
   What is
   a) 4 + 4
   4 + 4 = 1 (mod 7)
   b) 3 x 5
   3 x 5 = 1 (mod 7)
   c) what is the inverse of 3 ?
   3 x 5 = 1 (mod 7) // 5

2. For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} // Modulus 7
   Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ?
   Yes, this group would follow the properties (closure, associative, identity element, inverse element)

3. What is
   -13 mod 5 ?
   -13 % 5 = 2

4. Polynomials
   For the polynomial x3 − x2 + 4x − 12

   Find a the positive root ?
   x = 2 is a root

   What is the degree of this polynomial ?
   The degree is 3

##### Use cases

In your teams discuss any systems you have used that involved zero knowledge
proofs.

Have you seen any applications of zero knowledge proofs other than with a
blockchain ?

What is to you, the most important feature of zkp technology ?

Think of some use cases of zero knowledge proofs that you would like to see
developed.
